1. Abstract

The purpose of the project is providing a set of reusable chess (and also checkers) components to be used in any other chess-orientd application in Java.
We intend to provide the following stuff:
 - Customizable Chess Board Data Model (not only 8x8 board, but any others as well). Also we plan FischerChess (Chess960) support.
 - Chess Board View and Controller implementations using AWT/Swing (and other GUI libraries in the future) with support of customizable renderers and controllers
 - Chess Rules Implementation - the set of reusable methods for chess (checkers, etc.) move validation.
 - UCI (Unified Chess Interface) support providing a bridge to console based chess engines like Rybka or Fruit.
 - A lot of other things.

Each component will be provided as a JAR-module (independent or dependent from others), so it will be easy reusable in any other Java applications.
Some components (like Board Model or Chess Rules) should be compatible with JME (Java Micro Edition) as well.

NOTE: By the state on November 26, 2011 (the oficial starting date) we have already some experimental code which however doesn't satisfy to the declared specs in 100%.
      But we work on that!
